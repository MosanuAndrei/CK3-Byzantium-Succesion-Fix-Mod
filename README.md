# Byzantium Succesion Fix for Crusader Kings 3
  In vanilla Crusader Kings 3 whenever an emperor of the Byzantine Empire is ousted from power the succession changes from primogeniture to partition.
  This is very ahistorical considering the emperors never split or shared their imperial lands so it makes no sense and it's probably an oversight by the devs.

  To fix this i have changed the "Change Capital to Constantinople" decision to also change succession type back to primogeniture. This way whenever an emperor is ousted his successor will keep primogeniture.
